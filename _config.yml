summary: 'I am a Math and Physics double major at St Olaf College in Minnesota.  I am looking for a summer internship that
allows me to combine my love of the natural world with my love of math and science.  I have strong intra-personal and leadership
skills from many years working as a teacher and instructor at summer schools, theater programs, and skiing programs.  I have
outdoor skills from 15+ years of wilderness expeditions during summers in Alaska and Canada and a semester studying environmental
science and outdoor leadership at the High Mountain Institute in Colorado.'
